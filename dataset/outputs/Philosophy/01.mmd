What is Philosophy?+1. In this essay, I want to address the question: "What is philosophy?"

Footnote †: I am describing, of course, for the concept philosophy an exercise of the sort of recollective rationality (Hegel’s “Erinnerung”) considered for ordinary determinate empirical concepts in Chapter Three. B

We might to begin with acknowledge a distinction between things that have natures and things that have histories. Physical things such as electrons and aromatic compounds would be paradigmatic of the first class, while cultural formations such as English Romantic poetry and Ponzi schemes would be paradigmatic of the second. Applied to the case at hand, this distinction would surely place philosophy on the side of things that have histories. But now we might ask: Does philosophy differ in this respect from physics, chemistry, or biology? Physical, chemical, and biological things have natures rather than histories, but what about the disciplines that define and study them? Should physics itself be thought of as something that has a nature, or as something that has a history? Concluding the latter is giving a certain kind of pride of place to the historical. For it is in effect treating the distinction between things that have natures and things that have histories, between things studied by the Naturwissenschaften and things studied by the Geisteswissenschaften, as itself a cultural formation: the sort of thing that itself has a history rather than a nature. And from here it is a short step (though not, to be sure, an obligatory one) to the thought that natures themselves are the sort of thing that have a history; certainly the concepts electron and aromatic compound are that sort of thing. At this point the door is opened to a thorough-going historicism. It is often thought that this is the point to which Hegel--one of my particular heroes--brought us. I think that thought is correct, as far as it goes, but that we go very wrong if we think that that is where Hegel left us.

To say that philosophy is, at least to begin with, to be understood as the sort of thing that has a history rather than a nature is to foreground the way in which what deserves to be counted as distinctively philosophical activity answers to what has actually been done by those we recognize as precedential, tradition-transforming philosophers. One of Hegel's deepest and most important insights, I think, is indeed that the determinate contentfulness of any universal--in this case, the concept of philosophy--can only be understood in terms of the process by which it incorporates the contingencies of the particulars to which it has actually been applied. But he goes on from there to insist that it is in each case the responsibility of those of us who are heirs to such a conceptual tradition to see to it that is a rational tradition--that the distinction it embodies and enforces between correct and incorrect applications of a concept can be justified, that applying it in one case and withholding application in another is something for which reasons can be given. It is only insofar as we can do that that we are entitled to understand what we are doing as applying concepts. We fulfill that obligation by rationally reconstructing the tradition, finding a coherent, cumulative trajectory through it that reveals it as expressively progressive--as
