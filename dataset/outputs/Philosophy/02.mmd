the gradual unfolding into greater explicitness of commitments that can be seen retrospectively as always already having been implicit in it. That is, it is our job to rewrite the history so as to discover in it the revelation of what then retrospectively appears as an antecedent nature. Hegel balances the insight that even natures have histories by seeing rationality itself as imposing the obligation to construe histories as revelatory of natures.

The aim is to pick out a sequence of precedential instances or applications of a concept that amount to the delineation of a content for the concept, much as a judge at common law is obliged to do. Making the tradition rational, is not independent of the labor of concretely taking it to be so. It is a criterion of adequacy of each such Whiggish rewriting of our disciplinary history that it create and display continuity and progress by its systematic inclusions and exclusions. The discontinuities that correspond to shifts of topic, the forgetting of lessons, and the degeneration of research programs are invisible from within each such telling; but those differences live on in the spaces between the tellings. Each generation redefines its subject by offering a new retrospective reading of its characteristic concerns and hard-won lessons.+ut also, at any one time there will be diverse interpretations, complete with rival canons, competing designations of heroes, and accounts of their heroic feats. Making canons and baking traditions out of the rich ingredients bequeathed us by our discursive predecessors is a game that all can play.

Footnote †: I am describing, of course, for the concept philosophy an exercise of the sort of recollective rationality (Hegel’s “Erinnerung”) considered for ordinary determinate empirical concepts in Chapter Three. B

In this chapter, I am going to sketch one such perspective on what philosophers do--discern a nature as revealed by the history.

Ours is a broadly cognitive enterprise--I say 'broadly cognitive' to indicate that I mean that philosophers aim at a kind of understanding, not, more narrowly, at a kind of knowledge. To specify the distinctive sort of understanding that is the characteristic goal of philosophers' writing is to say what distinguishes that enterprise from that of other sorts of constructive seekers of understanding, such as novelists and scientific theorists. I want to do so by focusing not on the peculiar genre of nonfiction creative writing by which philosophical understanding is typically conveyed (though I think that subject is worthy of consideration), but rather on what is distinctive about the understanding itself: both its particular topic, and its characteristic goal. Philosophy is a self-reflexive enterprise: understanding is not only the goal of philosophical inquiry, but its topic as well. We are its topic; but it is us specifically as understanding creatures: discursive beings, makers and takers of reasons, seekers and speakers of truth. Seeing philosophy as addressing the nature and conditions of our rationality is, of course, a very traditional outlook--so traditional, indeed, that it is liable to seem quaint and oldfashioned. I'll address this issue later, remarking now only that rationalism is one thing, and intellectualism another: pragmatists, too, are concerned with the practices of giving and asking for reasons.
