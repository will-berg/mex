I understand the task of philosophers to have as a central element the explication of concepts--or, put slightly more carefully, the development and application of expressive tools with which to make explicit what is implicit in the use of concepts. When I say "explication of concepts", it is hard not to hear "analysis of meanings." There are obviously affinities between my specification and that which defined the concern specifically of "analytic philosophy" in the middle years of this century. Indeed, I intend, inter alia, to be saying what was right about that conception. But what I have in mind is different in various ways. Explication, making explicit, is not the same as analysis, at least as that notion was classically conceived. As I use the term, for instance, we have no more privileged access to the contents of our concepts than we do to the facts we use them to state; the concepts and the facts are two sides of one coin.

But the most important difference is that where analysis of meanings is a fundamentally conservative enterprise (consider the paradox of analysis), I see the point of explicating concepts rather to be opening them up to rational criticism. The rational enterprise, the practice of giving and asking for reasons that lies at the heart of discursive activity, requires not only criticizing beliefs, as false or unwarranted, but also criticizing concepts. Defective concepts distort our thought and constrain us by limiting the propositions and plans we can entertain as candidates for endorsement in belief and intention. This constraint operates behind our backs, out of our sight, since it limits what we are so much as capable of being aware of. Philosophy, in developing and applying tools for the rational criticism of concepts, seeks to free us from these fetters, by bringing the distorting influences out into the light of conscious day, exposing the commitments implicit in our concepts as vulnerable to rational challenge and debate.

2. The first thing to understand about concepts is that concept is a normative concept. This is a lesson we owe ultimately to Kant--the great, gray mother of us all. Kant saw us above all as traffickers in concepts. In fact, in a strict sense, all that kantian rational creatures can do is to apply concepts. For that is the genus he took to comprise both judgment and action, our theoretical activity and our practical activity. One of Kant's great innovations was his view that what in the first instance distinguishes judgments and actions from the mere behavior of denizens of the realm of nature is that they are things that we are in a distinctive sense responsible for. They express commitments of ours. The norms or rules that determine what we have committed ourselves to, what we have made ourselves responsible for, by making a judgment or performing an action, Kant calls 'concepts'. Judging and acting involves undertaking commitments whose credentials are always potentially at issue. That is, the commitments embodied in judgments and actions are ones we may or may not be entitled to, so that the question of whether they are correct, whether they are commitments we ought to acknowledge and embrace, can always be raised. One of the forms taken by the responsibility we undertake in judging and acting is the responsibility to give reasons that justify the judgment or the action. And the rules that are the concepts we apply in judging and acting determine what would count as a
