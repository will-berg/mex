reason for the judgment and the action.

Commitment, entitlement, responsibility--these are all normative notions. Kant replaces the ontological distinction between the physical and the mental with the deontological distinction between the realm of nature and the realm of freedom: the distinction between things that merely act regularly and things that are subject to distinctively normative sorts of assessment.

Thus for Kant the great philosophical questions are questions about the source and nature of normativity--of the bindingness or validity [Gultigkeit] of conceptual rules. Descartes had bequeathed to his successors a concern for certainty: a matter of our grip on concepts and ideas--paradigmatically, whether we have a hold on them that is clear and distinct. Kant bequeaths to his successors a concern rather for necessity: a matter of the grip concepts have on us, the way they bind or oblige us. 'Necessary' [notwendig] for Kant just means "according to a rule". (That is why he is willing to speak of moral and natural necessity as species of a genus.) The important lesson he takes Hume to have taught isn't about the threat of skepticism, but about how empirical knowledge is unintelligible if we insist on merely describing how things in fact are, without moving beyond that to prescribing how they must be, according to causal rules, and how empirical motivation (and so agency) is unintelligible if we stay at the level of 'is' and eschew reference to the 'ought's that outrun what merely is. Looking farther back, Kant finds "the celebrated Mr. Locke" sidetracked into a mere "physiology of the understanding"--the tracing of causal antecedents of thought in place of its justificatory antecedents--through a failure to appreciate the essentially normative character of claims to knowledge. But Kant takes the whole Enlightenment to be animated by an at least implicit appreciation of this point. For mankind's coming into its intellectual and spiritual majority and maturity consists precisely in taking the sort of personal responsibility for its commitments, both doxastic and practical, insisted upon already by Descartes' meditator.

This placing of normativity at the center of philosophical concern is the reason behind another of Kant's signal innovations: the pride of place he accords to judgment. In a sharp break with tradition, he takes it that the smallest unit of experience, and hence of awareness, is the judgment. This is because judgments, applications of concepts, are the smallest unit for which knowers can be responsible. Concepts by themselves don't express commitments; they only determine what commitments would be undertaken if they were applied. (Frege will express this kantian point by saying that judgeable contents are the smallest unit to which pragmatic force--paradigmatically the assertional force that consists in the assertor undertaking a special kind of commitment--can attach. Wittgenstein will distinguish sentences from terms and predicates as the smallest expressions whose free-standing utterance can be used to make a move in a language game.) The most general features of Kant's understanding of the form of judgment also derive from its role as a unit of responsibility. The "I think" that can accompany all representations (hence being, in its formality, the emptiest
