of all) is the formal shadow of the transcendental unity of apperception, the locus of responsibility determining a coresponsibility class of concept-applications (including actions), what is responsible for its judgments. The objective correlate of this subjective aspect of the form of judgment is the "object=X" to which the judgment is directed, the formal shadow of what the judgment makes the knower responsible to.

I think that philosophy is the study of us as creatures who judge and act, that is, as discursive, concept-using creatures. And I think that Kant is right to emphasize that understanding what we do in these terms is attributing to us various kinds of normative status, taking us to be subject to distinctive sorts of normative appraisal. So a central philosophical task is understanding this fundamental normative dimension within which we dwell. Kant's own approach to this issue, developing themes from Rousseau, is based on the thought that genuinely normative authority (constraint by norms) is distinguished from causal power (constraint by facts) in that it binds only those who acknowledge it as binding. Because one is subject only to that authority one subjects oneself to, the normative realm can be understood equally as the realm of freedom. So being constrained by norms is not only compatible with freedom--properly understood, it can be seen to be what freedom consists in. I don't know of a thought that is deeper, more difficult, or more important than this.

3. Kant's most basic idea, I said, is that judgment and action are things we are in a distinctive way responsible for. What does it mean to be responsible for them? I think the kind of responsibility in question should be understood to be task responsibility: the responsibility to do something. What (else) do judging and acting oblige us to do? The commitments we undertake by applying concepts in particular circumstances--by judging and acting--are ones we may or may not be entitled to, according to the rules (norms) implicit in those concepts. Showing that we are entitled by the rules to apply the concept in a particular case is justifying the commitment we undertake thereby, offering reasons for it. That is what we are responsible for, the practical content of our conceptual commitments. In undertaking a conceptual commitment one renders oneself in principle liable to demands for reasons. The normative appraisal to which we subject ourselves in judging and acting is appraisal of our reasons. Further, offering a reason for the application of a concept is always applying another concept: making or rehearsing another judgment or undertaking or acknowledging another practical commitment (Kant's "adopting a maxim"). Conceptual commitments both serve as and stand in need of reasons. The normative realm inhabited by creatures who can judge and act is not only the realm of freedom, it is the realm of reason.This story is told in more detail in Chapter One.Understanding the norms for correct application that are implicit in concepts requires understanding the role those concepts play in reasoning: what (applications of concepts) count as reasons for the application of that concept, and what (applications of concepts) the application of that concept counts as a reason for. For apart from such understanding, one cannot fulfill the responsibility one
