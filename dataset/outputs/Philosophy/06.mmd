undertakes by making a judgment or performing an action. So what distinguishes concept-using creatures from others is that we know our way around the space of reasons. Grasping or understanding a concept just is being able practically to place it in a network of inferential relations: to know what is evidence for or against its being properly applied to a particular case, and what its proper applicability to a particular case counts as evidence for or against. Our capacity to know (or believe) that something is the case depends on our having a certain kind of know how: the ability to tell what is a reason for what.

Footnote This story is told in more detail in Chapter One.:

The cost of losing sight of this point is to assimilate genuinely conceptual activity, judging and acting, too closely to the behavior of mere animals--creatures who do not live and move and have their being in the normative realm of freedom and reason. We share with other animals (and for that matter, with bits of automatic machinery) the capacity reliably to respond differentially to various kinds of stimuli. We, like they, can be understood as classifying stimuli as being of certain kinds, insofar as we are disposed to produce different repeatable sorts of responses to those stimuli. We can respond differentially to red things by uttering the noise "That is red." A parrot could be trained to do this, as pigeons are trained to peck at a different button when shown a red figure than when shown a green one. The empiricist tradition is right to emphasize that our capacity to have empirical knowledge begins with and crucially depends on such reliable differential responsive dispositions. But though the story begins with this sort of classification, it does not end there. For the rationalist tradition is right to emphasize that our classificatory responses count as applications of concepts, and hence as so much as candidates for knowledge, only in virtue of their role in reasoning. The crucial difference between the parrot's utterance of the noise "That is red," and the (let us suppose physically indistinguishable) utterance of a human reporter is that for the latter, but not the former, the utterance has the practical significance of making a claim. Doing that is taking up a normative stance of a kind that can serve as a premise from which to draw conclusions. That is, it can serve as a reason for taking up other stances. And further, it is a stance that itself can stand in need of reasons, at least if challenged by the adoption of other, incompatible stances. Where the parrot is merely responsively sounding off, the human counts as applying a concept just insofar as she is understood as making a move in a game of giving and asking for reasons.

The most basic point of Sellars' rationalist critique of empiricism in his masterwork "Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind," is that even the noninferentially elicited perceptual judgments that the empiricist rightly appreciates as forming the empirical basis for our knowledge can count as judgments (applications of concepts) at all only insofar as they are inferentially articulated. Thus the idea that there could be an autonomous language game (a game one could play though one played no other) consisting entirely of noninferentially elicited reports--whether of environing stimuli or of the present contents of one's own mind--is a radical mistake. To apply any concepts noninferentially, one must be able also to apply concepts inferentially. For it is an essential feature of concepts
