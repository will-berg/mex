that their applications can both serve as and stand in need of reasons. Making a report or a perceptual judgment is doing something that essentially, and not just accidentally, has the significance of making available a premise for reasoning. Learning to observe requires learning to infer. Experience and reasoning are two sides of one coin, two capacities presupposed by concept use that are in principle intelligible only in terms of their relations to each other.Chapter Seven develops this theme further.To claim that what distinguishes specifically conceptual classification from classification merely by differential responsive disposition is the inferential articulation of the response--that applications of concepts are essentially what can both serve as and stand in need of reasons--is to assign the game of giving and asking for reasons a preeminent place among discursive practices. For it is to say that what makes a practice discursive in the first place is that it incorporates reason-giving practices. Now of course there are many things one can do with concepts besides using them to argue and to justify. And it has seemed perverse to some post-Enlightenment thinkers in any way to privilege the rational, cognitive dimension of language use. But if the tradition I have been sketching is right, the capacity to use concepts in all the other ways explored and exploited by the artists and writers whose imaginative enterprises have rightly been admired by romantic opponents of logocentrism is parasitic on the prosaic inferential practices in virtue of which we are entitled to see concepts as in play in the first place. The game of giving and asking for reasons is not just one game among others one can play with language. It is the game in virtue of the playing of which what one has qualifies as language (or thought) at all. I am here disagreeing with Wittgenstein, when he claims that "language has no downtown." On my view, it does, and that downtown (the region around which all the rest of discourse is arrayed as dependent suburbs, is the practices of giving and asking for reasons. This is a kind of linguistic rationalism. 'Rationalism' in this sense does not entail intellectualism, the doctrine that every implicit mastery of a propriety of practice is ultimately to be explained by appeal to a prior explicit grasp of a principle. It is entirely compatible with the sort of pragmatism that sees things the other way around.

Footnote Chapter Seven develops this theme further.:

4. As I am suggesting that we think of them, concepts are broadly inferential norms that implicitly govern practices of giving and asking for reasons. Dummett has suggested a useful model for thinking about the inferential articulation of conceptual contents. Generalizing from the model of meaning Gentzen introduces for sentential operators, Dummett suggests that we think of the use of any expression as involving two components: the circumstances in which it is appropriately used and the appropriate consequences of such use. Since our concern is with the application of the concepts expressed by using linguistic expressions, we can render this as the circumstances of appropriate application of the concept, and the appropriate consequences of such application--that is, what follows from the concept's being applicable.

Some of the circumstances and consequences of applicability of a concept may
